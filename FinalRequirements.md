# Final Requirements is CS2510, Introduction to Game Programming @ University of Nebraska at Omaha

The following are the minimum requirements for your project. Note that I define project loosely; you can have multiple games, each of which covered a different requirement and you will be fine. Not that this requirements may change as the semester progresses and I have a better sense of what we will have time to cover.

- You need to have a game
- That game needs uses a game engine you coded from scratch
- Your game demonstrates understanding of the forest of scene trees concept
- Your game demonstrates understanding of the composition inheritance model
- Your game demonstrates understanding of how to create a game from text files (except custom components which will be in code)
- Your game demonstrates understanding of state machines (for example, correctly moving between scenes)
- Your game must have at least two scenes
- Your game demonstrates understanding of layers
- Your game demonstrates understanding of user input
- Your game demonstrates undersding of world space and pixel space
- Your game must have some form of UI
- Your game demonstrates understanding of collision detection
