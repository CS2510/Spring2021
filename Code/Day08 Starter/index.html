Note that in older tutorials you may see variable declarations that start with 'var' or no keyword before the variable name (i.e. name = 'Bob'). The best practice in 2021 is to use the keyword 'let'. Variables can also be declared with 'const'. This means a variable cannot be reassigned (otherwise it throws an exception).

        canvas.height = window.innerHeight //Note that ;s are optional in javascript.

            ctx.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height); //Clear the canvas so we can draw to it.

        //Specifies the time in milliseconds between frames
